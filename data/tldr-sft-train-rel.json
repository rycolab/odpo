Within a month we were already so close and I could see myself marrying this girl within a year or two (I'm 23, she's 26). We get along great, spend decent time together, and I can tell that she really cares about me. She has all the qualities of a good spouse, good mother, good life partner.\n\nWe've now been dating for 4-5 months and things are starting to slow down and I'm becoming less passionate about the relationship. I want to be with her, but i'm not crazy passionate about it. I don't wake up every morning with a burning desire to be with her, crazy about being with her. I know that it's unrealistic to have this feeling every minute of everyday, but I haven't felt that way since the first few weeks of our relationship.\n\nI also have to admit, even though it makes me feel shallow and a bad person, that my attraction to her isn't top notch. I am attracted to her, and we do have a physical aspect of our relationship, but she's not the most attractive women I know (or dated).\n\nI should also mention that we are both christain and that God is a central part of our relationship. Its something that we can share together and has been a good way to bring us together. I've slept with 2 girls before, she's a virgin, we have decided to wait before marriage to have sex. I'm ok with it, though I do fear that it will have an impact on our intimacy (possibly a source for my lack of attraction?)\n\nSo what should I do? Am i expecting too much from the relationship?

Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues).

She asked him what had happened and if they even used protection but he wouldn't admit to anything. He wouldn't even say that they had sex. Soon after rumors circulated as they do in high school. She was always known as being incredibly innocent, hell she is a pastor's daughter, but now guys started asking her out of the blue if she would have sex with them if she was drunk. Also rumors got out that she was pregnant (she wasn't).\nAll this had a devastating impact on her self esteem and ego, meanwhile her boyfriend had gotten seriously depressed and was absolutely intolerable to deal with. The guy from the party started talking to her again. They met a few times under different circumstances, he would get her drunk, and have sex with her.\nShe left her boyfriend and soon after stopped seeing the other guy too.

This morning in class, i was tickling her, and she was perfectly fine.

I just recently got out of a long term relationship of 5 years. My ex and I used to attend the same university, but I got into med school and since moved away. The distance was rough on us, and it led to a lot of changes on my end. In the end, we decided to end it and did so amicably. When we first broke up, I asked that we remain friends and still update one another one each other's lives. At first, I thought that I could easily fall back into being friends with him, but I realized that it was too painful to talk to him or text him and be reminded of the end of the relationship. \n\nA few days after the break up, he called me, and I didn't pick up because I knew it would be too painful to speak to him. I sent him an email explaining that I wanted no contact for a little while so that we could both heal from the break up. I did have nothing from him for a day or so, but this morning I woke up and saw a text from him wishing me luck for an upcoming test. Seeing the text made me sad and a little upset that he is unwilling to respect the no-contact rule that I requested.\n\nI think that he continues to reach out to me because he doesn't have as good of a support group as I do (family and friends who support me and check in on me periodically), and for the past 5 years, I was that support.
