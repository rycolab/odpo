We had a great time together. Spent about 10 hours in total, including some heavy making out and fooling around. The problem is, she's a lot heavier than I had been anticipating.

He actually never formally told us, we kind of found out through seeing open emails and texts.  But anyway.  My family (minus me) & dads girlfriend went away on vacation for a week to visit my dads grandparents, and apparently it didn't go so well.  My sibling overhead the two talking, and thought it sounded like they were arguing about why they shouldn't tell his parents about something and she shouldn't wear something.  Vague, yeah.  But he's been secretive about what he has gotten her for Christmas and has said somethings that seem to hint he's proposed to her.\n\nI want to approach this situation in a calm manner, but I'm not sure how.  I know I'll be quite annoyed and offended if he doesn't tell us soon (one of his weird things is to keep important information from people, like not telling his parents that my sibling is having a baby), and so I don't want it to get to the point where he eventually tells us and I'll have trouble forgiving him for not even talking to us about it until he's planning the wedding or some shit.": {"responses": [" My dad might be engaged, don't know how to approach it.", " My dad might be engaged, don't know how to approach it", " First off, my dad is a really strange guy.
